# üêô Here are my hand-crafted dotfiles!

## Overview

You can use these info whatever you want, but be aware that these files were
crafted on my personal preferences. Please read the files, and make your custom
modifications adapted to your personal needs.

## Notes

The .emacs config file is my precius! multi platform and very very dense,
but also heavily commented and easy to follow. I don't know how many hours I spent
making and recolecting pieces for put together this monster! 1000 lines later here is for You!
